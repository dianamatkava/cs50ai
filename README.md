## Minesweeper Game

### Description:
Minesweeper game implemented with `pygame`, offering both solo play and the option for an AI player. The Minesweeper game follows the classic rules where the player must uncover all cells on the board.

## Implementation
The game implementation utilizes **Propositional Logic** for intelligent decision-making.


# Write an AI to assess the likelihood that a person will have a particular genetic trait.

### Model Bayesian Network

The task in this project is to use this model to make inferences about a population. Given information about people, who their parents are, and whether they have a particular observable trait (e.g. hearing loss) caused by a given gene, the AI will infer the probability distribution for each personâ€™s genes, as well as the probability distribution for whether any person will exhibit the trait in question.
